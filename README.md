This is a first exercise in writing aprogram using javascript. It will be 
simple and use only the basics neccessary at this stage and will be further 
developed at a later stage.

Note that if you download the code and want to run it locally you will have 
to change the start of the links to the other directories as they are
currently set up to run remotely from github.
